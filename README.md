(in review). Mapping Ecosystem Services to Human Well-being: a toolkit to support integrated landscape management for the Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition the base script available in V1.0, MESH_SDG V2.0 generates new SDG graphics and includes instructions on how to change the default values and weightings.

The MESH-SDG tool is designed to illustrate how changes in ecosystem services under alternative land use land cover conditions could impact on progress towards the United Nationâ€™s 2015-2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).  It was developed primarily for use with the MESH modelling tool (http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/mesh/) with funding from Bioversity International, NCEAS, Science for People and Nature, and the Natural Capital Project. 

Tool documentation and guidelines for use are available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Oc-p8iw1kw40PFjfW3a1W7GSimoMbvDeRvPlczMqCQ/edit?usp=sharing
